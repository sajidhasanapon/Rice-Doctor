## Identification and recognition of rice diseases and pests using convolutional neural networks 


This project is more than 3 years old now and even though I was the one writing it, I have no clue about how the code works anymore. I don't even know if it works at all.

I thought I had lost this project but then found it in my Google Drive a couple of minutes ago. So now I'm uploading this to Git Hub just because of my annoying *cannot throw them away, keeps anything and everything* nature (and maybe to make my resume look a bit better?).

This work got published (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2020.03.020) in a top-notch journal. I did design the experiments, wrote this codebase, and reported the results but I don't know a thing about writing the manuscript or submitting it. For details about that, ask Rafeed or Arko.
